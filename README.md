## 👨‍💻 About Me  

I build scalable and reproducible Machine Learning and AI systems, taking them from concept through to evaluation and deployment. I enjoy working on projects that solve real problems and can actually be used, not just demoed. My goal is to create impactful AI solutions and secure a high-impact role where I can contribute to serious ML/AI products and research.

My core focus areas include:
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Computer Vision.

This GitHub serves as a curated portfolio of my best work for recruiters, hiring managers, and collaborators.

## Highlights

- End-to-end projects: dataset curation → model training → evaluation → inference & deployment
- Hands-on experience in areas like segmentation, machine translation (NMT), and fraud detection
- Strong working knowledge of PyTorch, Transformers, and scikit-learn
- Experience with practical ML engineering tools: Docker, structured training pipelines, experiment tracking, and reproducible           configurations
